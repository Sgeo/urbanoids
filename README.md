# Urbanoids
 HTML5 conversion of JavaOnTheBrain.com's Urbanoids
 
 This is just throwing Urbanoids into CheeryJ (or rather letting the CheeryJ Javascript convert at page load).
 
 The music is also made accessible to modern browsers. Currently, the SID is an MP3 from [Stone Oakvalley's Authentic SID Collection](http://www.6581-8580.com/), and the MOD uses [chiptune2.js](https://github.com/deskjet/chiptune2.js)
