Prepare to explore the widths and depths of a city full of homicidal robots.<p>

This is what the game looks like. If you think it seems incomprehensible or even
just a tiny bit complicated, I suggest you drop by the <a href="instructions.html">
instructions</a> page first.<p>

If that happens to capture your interest, why not also read the
<a href="story.html">story</a> while you are at it?<p>

When you feel ready, open up a game window by clicking
<a href="JavaScript:small_window('tpanindex.html');">here</a>, or on the picture.

<b>Important:</b> Some newer versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer
contain a bug that messes up the graphics of the game when the background
is scrolling. If you experience that problem, you can try
<a href="JavaScript:small_window('wtpanindex.html');">this modified
game</a> which has a different scrolling algorithm. It takes slightly
more processor power, but if you have a fast machine that shouldn't matter.
