<h3>The basics</h3>
This is the control panel. The window to the left is where all the action will be.
The one to the right displays various kinds of information.<p>
<img src="graphics/panel.gif" align=left>
While playing, you move the main character around with the I, J, K and L keys
and fire with SPACE. The background will scroll and follow you along. You can also
climb in and out of the sewers (see below).
<p>
The rounded objects with numbers on them are symbolic representations of droids.
Your enemies. The bad guys. All of them have to be killed. You do that by
shooting at them or crushing them with brute force. Of course, they can do the
same to <em>you</em>. (Otherwise this wouldn't be any fun, would it?)<p>

You have a force field which protects you from direct physical injury, but all
collisions wear down your energy supply. So does shooting.
When it's all gone, your power pack
has a tendency to explode and, well, kill you rather violently, so try not
to let that happen.<p>

At any time during the game you can press the S key to pause it. In that state,
clicking on any droid (or yourself) will bring up statistics about it in the
information window. You get to see, for example, what strength, shields and
firepower it is equipped with. Pressing G starts the game again.<br clear=left>

<h3>Important objects</h3>

The graphics have been deliberately created to make it obvious what
you can walk on and which things are obstacles. But these items probably
need an explanation:
<p>

<table border=0 width=300>
<tr><td><img src="graphics/battery.gif"></td><td>Battery.
Aside from being worth 25 points, it replenishes part of your energy.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="graphics/exit.gif"></td><td>Manhole. Enter the sewers
by pressing D.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="graphics/entrance.gif"></td><td>Exit. Go up again by pressing E.
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Taking over droids</h3>

This isn't one of those mindless games you can beat by just running around
and shooting at everything that moves. (I thought I'd try something different
this time.) A good strategy is essential. The armors of some
of the droids are simply too strong for your standard weapon. Sooner or later
you will need to upgrade.<p>

The way you acquire better strength, shields and firepower is by hacking
into droids and taking control of them. Then you can ride the droid and
get access to all its capabilities. And if you run out of energy, only
the droid gets killed. You'll be safe ... for a while.<p>

All droids have a neural network processor which works as a brain.
Leading out from it,
sending directives to the body, is a <em>neural brain stem</em>. This
happens to be very sensitive to outside influence. By feeding electrical
impulses through the right cables, you can block out the droid's processor
and gain control over all motoric parts -- wheels, limbs and weapons.
But droids also have a built-in defense which will try to counteract
your tampering by sending impulses of its own into the brain stem. The
better the operating system, the tougher the defense.<p>

To initiate a takeover attempt, hold down the T key and get in physical
contact with a droid. Then you will be presented with the following screen:<p>

<table width="100%" border=0>
<tr><td width=148>
<img src="graphics/takeover.gif"></td>
<td>
<ol>
<li>Influence meter. This shows which side is currently dominant.
<li>Spare impulse generators. Release a new one by pressing SPACE or K.
<li>Color switch. Any impulse sent through it will change into the opponent's type.
<li>Junction. Splits or combines impulses.
<li>Active impulse generator. It transmits a signal for a few seconds and then
fades away.
<li>The neural brain stem of the unit you are trying to take over.
<li>Timer. When it runs out, the dominant side wins.
</ol>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
Move your impulse generators up and down. When they are in a proper position,
press SPACE to make them fire a signal. (It may take a couple of tries before
you get the hang of it.)<p>

If you lose, your power source or the droid you are presently in control of will
burn out and explode. If you win, on the other hand, the other droid is then
your property, and instead of your character on the screen you will see
a representation of that droid, but colored white. Now, in addition to its
strength, shields and firepower you will also have access to its operating system,
which may make it easier to take over other droids, in turn.

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<table align=right width=200 border=1>
<tr><td>
<div align=center><big><big><b>Model 100</b></big></big><br>
<img src="info/m100.gif"></div>
<small>
<b>Class:</b> Household<br>
<b>Name:</b> Home surveillance droid, a.k.a. "Door stop"<br>
<b>Firepower:</b> None<br>
<b>Armor:</b> Level 1, plastic<br>
<b>Strength:</b> Level 1<br>
<b>Natural speed:</b> 4 km/h<br>
<b>Operating System:</b> CP/M<br>
</small>
</td></tr></table>
When you click on a droid during the paused state, the information you
get looks something like this.<p>

There are five different droid classes: household (red), maintenance (yellow),
construction (green), law enforcement (blue) and military (black).
Household droids are typically the dumbest and weakest, with the rest
ranging in that order up to the military droids, which are the smartest
and most powerful. The number identifies the specific droid model -- in
this case the "Model 100, home surveillance droid."<p>

The level values of <b>Firepower</b> and <b>Strength</b> determine the
offensive capabilities of the droid, for shooting and bumping respectively.
Similarly, the <b>Armor</b> value determines its <em>defensive</em>
capability. A level 3 armor will protect against firepower up to
level 3, and so on. (You can also hear, when you are shooting at a robot, if
your bullets just bounce off. Then there's a "plink" sound instead of a
crash.)<p>

<b>Natural speed</b> is how fast the droid can move on its own.

<h3>Scoring</h3>

This part is pretty simple. If you kill a droid you get as many points
as its model number. If you take over it you get twice that amount.
And the batteries, as previously stated, are worth 25 points each.

<h3>Overview map</h3>

<img src="graphics/map.gif" align=left>
Clicking the little button that says "MAP" brings up (you guessed it)
a symbolic map of the current area. It doesn't contain any information
about the terrain -- just the relative locations of you, the remaining
droids and the batteries.<p>
Clicking on the "OK" button sends you back to the game screen.
<br clear=all>

<h3>Optional music</h3>
The game comes with a background tune in three formats: MIDI, MOD and SID. If
you have a fast computer and the appropriate browser plug-in installed, just
click on the corresponding button to play it. Click NONE if you wish to turn
it off.
